## I will use this repo to list all the research papers that I have read (and hopefully understood!)

1. A Large-scale benchmark for instance-level recognition and retrieval: This paper introduces the GLDv2 dataset [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-2020/discussion/164769)

2. M4 Competition- 100,000 time series and 61 forecasting methods: introduces the M4 competition dataset [Link](https://medium.com/@aakashg80/m4-competition-100k-timeseries-61-forecasting-methods-31e3b0549a56)

3. A hybrid method of exponential smoothing and recurrent neural networks for time series forecasting: This article explains the method used by the M4 winning algorithm [Link](https://medium.com/@aakashg80/m4-competition-winner-using-es-with-rnns-for-time-series-forecasting-1c86058c26e5)
