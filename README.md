## This repo will list my notes on all the research papers that I have read  
(...and hopefully understood!)

Why only 100 papers! I don't know? I am not a researcher...in the traditional terms. But I do like to keep myself abreast of the latest developments in the ML/DL space. My interest is in its application. Its like what Andrew Ng has said - The power of AI/ML is not what SOTA models they build. But how they help in improving the lives of people. 

This is my humble endevour to understand the latest research. 

1. A Large-scale benchmark for instance-level recognition and retrieval: This paper introduces the GLDv2 dataset [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-2020/discussion/164769)
